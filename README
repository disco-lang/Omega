Omega -- Operations on Presburger arithmetic formulae

This package contains a reduced copy of the Omega library.
The Omega library's home page is http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/omega/, and
its full sources are at http://github.com/davewathaverford/the-omega-project/.

BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS
---------------------

This is a Cabal package.  The typical build process is:

	runhaskell Setup.hs configure <FLAGS>
	runhaskell Setup.hs build
	runhaskell Setup.hs install

Configure with -fUseInstalledOmega if you have already installed the C++
Omega library.  Otherwise, the library will be built and linked into this
package.

GHCi is not supported due to dynamic loading problems.

Because this package contains C++ source code, Cabal may need help
finding the required headers and libraries.  You may need to provide the paths
to the C++ include directory (contains STL headers such as "vector") and
library directory (contains the C runtime library, called "libstdc++.so" on
GNU Linux systems).  If the C++ Omega library is not installed in a standard
place, you will also need to provide paths to it.

A configuration might look something like this:

	runhaskell Setup.hs configure --disable-library-for-ghci -p \
		--extra-include-dirs=$(YOUR_CXX_INCLUDE_PATH) \
		--extra-lib-dirs=$(YOUR_CXX_LIB_PATH)

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

The C++ Omega library includes documentation of its exported interface in
'interface.dvi'.  You may wish to look there if the Haddock documentation for
a set operation or relation operation is lacking.
